Client Meeting Notes:

-We have been given the okay to change the format of the website and add a login page 
	-Deborah asked for certain "restrictions" to be put on different users
		~i.e Regular clinician: can perform tests, add and delete clients
		     Local Moderator:   can edit clinician lists, have access to statistics, all local information
		     Global Moderator:  can look at statistics and information of all users and clients throughout all aps
	(seems a bit much for this semester, but we should be able to atleast get a user page going)
Importing/exporting database:
	-Database was for the user to export the data to a different format (possibly JSON?)
	-Import is probably useless, as we can import info from global database (unless they're importing from different app?)

     
Tabs
	-Deborah was onboard with the idea of separating things into tabs
	-Makes everything look a bit neater and gives website a nice flow

Misc
	-Would like the logos to be used more, in the regular app it's only seen when you open it
	-Put it on top left as home button, also can position it around for other pages
