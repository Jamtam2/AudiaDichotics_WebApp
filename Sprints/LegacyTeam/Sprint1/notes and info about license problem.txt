questions to ask support:

However, I did have a few questions you may be able to answer about the process. 
1st when the code signing certificate is purchased, do you receive a private key, code signing request instructions, and a public key?
Or is the private key generated after a certificate request is made?

Another IT professional that built the software said that "Easiest thing to do is just start a new certificate request and importantly save the private key that is generated! I will need the private key along with the issued certificate so that I can create a signing certificate for the software."
Does this process he describes include purchasing a new code signing certificate?


All help appreciated,
Wilson



Notes about the isse:

1. install audio dichotic software
2. put in key generated when purchased
3. (does key work?) (is the issue the key that is generated when purchasing the software?)

4. Keys being generated after purchase do not work. 
This is due to the code signing certificate being out of date.


5. Get a hold of comodo and either, 
renew the old code signing certificate, 
or get a new code signing certificate.

6. Follow Comodo's judgement and try to give them all info needed, contact deborah if needed.
