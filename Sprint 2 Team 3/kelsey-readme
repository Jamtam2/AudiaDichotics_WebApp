The speech-api branch is what I worked on for sprint 2. Right now it will not run because in order to use it,
our team needs for the sponsor to have a paid account for AssemblyAI, as it is a locked feature otherwise. I have
added the required code in the mean time. It was a python sdk but I translated it to ruby. I will have to do more work
as there is pyaudio that needs to be installed, and I'm not sure yet how I would do that with ruby.
