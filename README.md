# Ears Project
## Overview
Audia Dichotics aims to provide a scalable web application using Ruby on Rails to diagnose and treat hearing difficulties in children. The previous software had licensing issues, necessitating this rebuild. As of Summer 2024, the web app is live with full functionality; including:
- Full user functionality with Stripe for payment processing.
- Google MFA and email verification for enhanced security.
- Ongoing development for a training feature and voice activation feature.

### Website

The application is live and can be accessed at [audiadichotics.com](http://www.audiadichotics.com/).

### Work In Progress

- **Training Feature:** Exercises to correct hearing deficiencies.

## What is Amblyaudia?

Amblyaudia is an auditory processing deficit due to weaknesses in binaural integration. It can be assessed through dichotic listening tests and treated with ARIA training programs.

**Tools designed to aid listening and learning**

Dichotics Inc provides tools to assess and rehabilitate individuals with amblyaudia.

- **Identify children at risk of amblyaudia.**
- **Interpret and report test results.**
- **Backed by research evidence.**

Our software integrates sound files for the DWT and RDDT, scores patient responses, and generates detailed reports.
