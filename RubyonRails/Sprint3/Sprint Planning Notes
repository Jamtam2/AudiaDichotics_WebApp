Sprint Planning Notes

Wilson:
Testing pages
	-get audio worked out and hopefully integrated into page (maybe even the swap audio button?)
	-Implement the tests as a table on the right that you can interact with
	-have it calculate a score for the testing and output a Diagnosis, and percentages

LJ:
Home Page + Nav Bar Overhaul
	-tidy up homepage and make it look more decent
	-Nav bar does not flow well with how the page is set up, mostly because it's on the top right
Users
	-Add a clinicians(users) sign in and sign out page
	-Users index page, sign up page, etc

Sunny:
Tabs
	-Add tabbing to Client page and index, have all of the information output onto one page
	-Add seeds to database for users for now, so it doesn't look so empty
Emergency Contact
	-Make emergency contact it's own object connect to clients add it onto it's own page
