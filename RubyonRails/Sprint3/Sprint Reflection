Sprint Reflection Notes

Github
	-Commit and pull requests more regularly 
		~a lot of troubleshooting since we all did work on different versions of the code
Ruby
	-Also had trouble since Ruby 2.7.2 doaes not work on Shahzeb's computer, but works on LJ and Wilson's computer.
		~some code aspects work on 2.7.2 but don't work on 3.1.1, and vice versa
Teammates
	-Communication was good, we usually were available anytime someone needed someone to check a pull request, or needed to ask a question
	-We've made good progress on the app, no one seems to be slacking off or procrastinating
	-Overall Team is really good
